# Telegram Music Bot 🎵

A Telegram bot for crowd-curated music queues at **parties, bars, or events** — without giving guests direct access to your Spotify account.

Users send Spotify track links to the bot, and song requests are forwarded to a **voting chat**, where designated users can **approve or decline** each track. Approved tracks are automatically added to your **Spotify playback queue**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Forwards requests to a **voting chat** (group or private)
- ✅ Vote to **Add to Queue** or ❌ Decline
- 🔐 No direct access to Spotify required for requesters
- 🎶 Perfect for **bars, parties, and shared listening sessions**

## ✅ Telegram Group Requirements

If your **voting chat is a Telegram group**, make sure to:

1. **Add the bot as a member of the group**
2. **Allow the bot to read messages** — it needs this to process `/spotifylogin` and voting responses

> 📌 *If the voting chat is a **private chat with a Telegram user**, no special permissions are required.*

---

## 🔑 Spotify Authentication

From the **voting chat**, send:

```text
/spotifylogin
```

This starts the login flow. After authenticating, Spotify will redirect you to a URL like:

```text
http://localhost:8888/callback?code=...
```

It will likely show an error in the browser — **this is expected**. Just **copy the full URL** and **paste it into the Telegram chat**. The bot will store the session.

If the bot loses access in the future, repeat the `/spotifylogin` process.
